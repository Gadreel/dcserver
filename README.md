# dcServer
Web server, database and CMS

## Schedule

With 14 production clients, dcServer is proving to be a successful multipurpose web server. While our source code is open and published we are not yet ready to provide builds. This project will undergo a migration to OpenJDK 11 during 2019, focusing on the Corretto 11 release. Once the migration is complete we will provide builds and documentation.

## Download 

Instructions on download and running coming. TODO

## Build

Build the JARs using Maven. First `mvn install` in dcraft.third and then `mvn install` in dcraft.hub folder. While this creates the JAR files, you are not ready to run. Instructions on how to run are above. If you want to be sure your compiled code is used, in favor over the downloaded code, please copy the JARs from the respective target folders to the `lib` folder of the downloads.
