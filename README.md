# dcServer
Web server, database and CMS

## Schedule

With 14 production clients, dcServer is proving to be a successful multipurpose web server. While our source code is open and published we are not yet ready to provide builds. This project will undergo a migration to OpenJDK 11 during 2019, focusing on the Corretto 11 release. Once the migration is complete we will provide builds and documentation.
