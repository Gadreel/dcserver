# dcServer
Web server, database and CMS

## Status

With 20 production websites, dcServer is proving to be a successful multipurpose web server. The project has recently been migrated to OpenJDK 11 (spring 2019), using the Corretto 11 release. The source code compiles. Project lacks documentation on how to run and code using dcServer - planned for summer and fall of 2019.

## Download 

Instructions on download and running coming. TODO

## Build

Build the JARs using Maven. First `mvn install` in dcraft.third and then `mvn install` in dcraft.hub folder. While this creates the JAR files, you are not ready to run. Instructions on how to run are above. If you want to be sure your compiled code is used, in favor over the downloaded code, please copy the JARs from the respective target folders to the `lib` folder of the downloads.
